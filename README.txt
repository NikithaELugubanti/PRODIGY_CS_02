Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption

Description:
This project demonstrates image encryption and decryption using a simple XOR-based pixel manipulation technique. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption processes, ensuring that the image can be restored to its original state after encryption.

Features:

Encryption: Converts an image into an encrypted format using a specified key.
Decryption: Converts an encrypted image back to its original format using the same key.
XOR Operation: Utilizes the XOR bitwise operation for encryption and decryption, making it simple yet effective.

Running the Code:
--Encryption:
1.Run the encryption code.
2.Provide the path to the image file.
3.Enter the encryption key when prompted.

--Decryption:
1.Run the decryption code.
2.Provide the path to the encrypted image file.
3.Enter the same key used for encryption.
